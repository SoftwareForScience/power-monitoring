The client is required to record the temperature of the processing nodes, it does this by sending the data over the network to the logger.
\subsection{Setup}
The clients don't require much setup, other than an active internet connection, as mentioned in section \ref{lsetup}. For ease of installation and use, it's also highly recommended to add the Ansible hosts group as mentioned in section \ref{linstall}. Only this time the hosts group should only contain the pi's that will run the test programs. In our case this made for a group that looked like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
[sfs]
raspberrypi-0.local ansible_user=pi
raspberrypi-1.local ansible_user=pi
raspberrypi-2.local ansible_user=pi
raspberrypi-3.local ansible_user=pi
\end{lstlisting}
