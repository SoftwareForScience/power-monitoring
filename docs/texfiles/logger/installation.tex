\subsection{Installation} \label{linstall}
To install the logger, make sure you have the data logger pi setup in your ansible hosts file. In our case this file was located in  \code{/etc/ansible/hosts} and contained the following lines:\newline 
 \code{[sgs]\newline
raspberrypi-g.local ansible\_user=pi}\newline
This means that you can run the playbook file \code{ansible/installG.yaml} with the following command: \code{ansible-playbook ansible/installG.yaml -l sgs}.
