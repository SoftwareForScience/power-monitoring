  # To configure Keystone correctly, a project-scoped token must be acquired.
  # To accomplish this, the configuration must be set up with one of the
  # following scenarios:
  #   Set username and password and you have a default project set in keystone.
  #   Set username, password and project id.
  #   Set username, password, project name and (domain id or domain name).

  # service_type ('monitoring' by default), endpoint_type ('publicURL' by default) and/or
  # region_name (none by default).
